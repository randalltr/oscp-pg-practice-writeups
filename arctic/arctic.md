## 1. Executive Summary

A penetration test was conducted against the target host *Arctic* to assess its security posture. The assessment identified a vulnerable and outdated Adobe ColdFusion service that allowed remote command execution, leading to an initial foothold. Further misconfigurations enabled privilege escalation to SYSTEM-level access.

Complete compromise of the system was achieved, demonstrating critical risk to the target environment.
