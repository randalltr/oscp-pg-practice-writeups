# OSCP / PG Practice Pentest Reports

This repository contains my personal **OSCP/PEN-200 practice writeups**, including:

- Full pentest-style reports
- Step-by-step exploitation notes
- Privilege escalation paths
- Lessons learned per machine

Everything here comes from **legitimate, controlled environments** like HackTheBox and OffSec PG Practice.

## Purpose

This repo is a consolidated study log for:

- PEN-200 progression
- OSCP exam preparation
- Tracking methodology improvement
- Maintaining consistent reporting structure
- Building repeatable habits across boxes

The goal: sharpen process, reduce noise, and create muscle memory.
