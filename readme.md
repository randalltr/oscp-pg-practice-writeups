## Repository Structure

Each directory represents a single target machine and contains:

- **Pentest Report** (OSCP-style)
- **Enumeration & Exploitation Notes**
- **Privilege Escalation Steps**
- **Lessons Learned**

---

## Purpose

This repo is a consolidated study log for:

- PEN-200 progression
- OSCP exam preparation
- Tracking methodology improvement
- Maintaining consistent reporting structure
- Building repeatable habits across boxes

The goal: sharpen process, reduce noise, and create muscle memory.

---

## Report Format

All reports follow a standard outline:

0. Lessons Learned
1. Executive Summary
2. Scope
3. Methodology
4. Information Gathering
5. Enumeration
6. Initial Access
7. Post-Exploitation
8. Privilege Escalation
9. Proof of Compromise
10. Findings & Recommendations
11. Appendix

This mirrors what OSCP expects on exam day.
